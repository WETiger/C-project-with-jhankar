<p>HTML <strong>(HyperText Markup Language)</strong> was invented by <em>Tim Berners-Lee</em> in <small>1989</small> as part of the World Wide Web. It was initially designed to structure documents and allow for linking between them, which formed the basis for the web's ability to share information.
